# AI-Virtual-Mouse
AI Virtual Mouse is a computer vision project built using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI that allows users to control their computer with hand gestures. It supports smooth cursor movement, left and right click, scrolling, and drag-and-drop using real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition through a webcam.
